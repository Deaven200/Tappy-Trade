=== STRESS TEST ROUND 1 ERRORS & ISSUES ===

1. Browser Console: Failed to load resource: the server
   responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) for favicon.ico.

2. Browser Console: Warning: 'viewport-fit=cover' is a
   deprecated meta tag.

3. Logic Bug: Player Market 'Total' price and validation
   logic is stuck on default quantity (10) even when the
   user inputs a different number.

4. UI Issue: Chat input field does not clear instantly
   after the 'Send' button is clicked.

5. UI Issue: Modals (like Chat and Daily Rewards) can
   overlap and block background interactions without a
   clear overlay priority.


=== STRESS TEST ROUND 2 ERRORS & ISSUES ===

1. Market 'Total' Price Bug: The "Total" price display
   logic is not reactive enough. It remains 'stuck' at $50
   (default) when fields are cleared or contain invalid
   inputs (negative/NaN), which could mislead users.

2. Chat History Bug (Guest): Chat messages sent as Guest
   did not appear in the scrollable history immediately
   after being sent during the test session.

3. Browser Console Warning: 'The specified value ... cannot
   be parsed, or is out of range' when entering strings/NaN
   into number inputs (Expected behavior for stress test,
   but clogging console).

4. UI Visual Glitch: Rapidly switching tabs can briefly
   leave the 'active' highlight on multiple navigation
   buttons simultaneously.

5. UI Performance: Chat input field clearing is slightly
   delayed, allowing for potential double-sends if
   spam-clicked (though rate limit seems effective).


=== STRESS TEST ROUND 3 (NEW PLAYER) ERRORS & ISSUES ===

1. Reset Game Bug: "Reset Game" button in Menu provides no
   UI feedback and does not reset money (stayed at $16).

2. Tuition/Onboarding: No tutorial or 'New Player' popups
   appeared. The player is dropped in without guidance.

3. UI Confusion: Government menu shows progress but has no
   "Sell" button, leading to confusion on how to interact
   with it.

4. Logic/UI: Player Market "Total" price calculation is
   misleading (calculates based on input quantity vs owned
   stock).

5. Pacing: Early game feels slightly "grindy" (6 mins to
   first automation) with only manual clicking and waiting.


=== STRESS TEST ROUND 5 (SECURITY) ERRORS & ISSUES ===

1. CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: Negative Quantity Buy Order.
   The game does not validate if `quantity > 0` in `buyFromGov`
   or market order creation. Buying -1M items grants +$5M cash.

2. Logic Bug: Daily Reward Claim.
   `dailyRewards.js` tries to add `reward.m` (money), but the
   config object likely uses `reward.reward` or `reward.value`.
   The player gets $0 even when the claim is successful.

3. Exploit: Time Travel.
   Client-side clock trust allows bypassing cooldowns for daily
   rewards by manipulating `S.lastDailyReward`.

4. Exploit: Save Manipulation.
   No checksum or server validation for Guest saves allows editing
   `localStorage` to grant infinite money/items.
   (Note: Less critical for single-player/guest mode).


=== STRESS TEST ROUND 6 (ADVANCED) ERRORS & ISSUES ===

1. Government Tier Persistence Bug (Guest):
   Guest players lose all "Government Tier" progress upon page
   reload. The `playerTiers` object is stored in memory and only
   synced to Firebase (which Guests don't have), failing to
   save to `localStorage`.


=== STRESS TEST ROUND 7 (TEN NEW THINGS) ERRORS & ISSUES ===

1. Major Feature Missing: Offline Progress.
   Simulating offline time yields 0 progress. Modal/Functions (`showOfflineProgress`)
   missing from codebase despite config `MAX_OFFLINE_HOURS`.

2. Content Missing: Plot 2 (Forest).
   Workers tab displays placeholder "Plot 1" cards instead of the intended
   "Plot 2" unlock, making progression past the first plot impossible.

3. Anti-Spam Failure.
   Chat allows sending identical messages repeatedly with no cooldown or
   spam detection.

4. UI/UX: High Value Formatting.
   Money values > $1 Billion display as long integers (e.g., 1,500,000,000)
   instead of abbreviated formats (1.5B), impacting readability.


=== STRESS TEST ROUND 8 (NEXT 10 THINGS) ERRORS & ISSUES ===

1. Logic Bug: Demolition Refund.
   Demolishing a building does NOT refund 50% cost as intended.
   Money balance remains unchanged.

2. Logic Bug: Hard Reset.
   `resetGame()` function exists but fails to wipe `S.money` or `S.plots`
   effectively. Player retains progress after reset.

3. Code Issue: Event System.
   `triggerEvent` function is defined but not exposed globally or
   accessible via `main.js`. Random events may not be firing at all.

4. UI Issue: Notification Stacking.
   Multiple toasts stack directly on top of each other in the center
   of the screen, making text unreadable during high-activity moments.


=== STRESS TEST ROUND 9 (EDGE CASES) ERRORS & ISSUES ===

1. Feature Missing: Prestige/Rebirth.
   No endgame prestige mechanics found in codebase despite idle game genre.

2. Feature Missing: Game Pause.
   No ability to pause the game loop (`stopGameLoop` missing).

3. UX: Chat Command Feedback.
   Typing invalid or admin commands like `/help` provides no client-side
   feedback (though commands may not be implemented at all).


=== STRESS TEST ROUND 10 (FINAL POLISH) ERRORS & ISSUES ===

1. Logic Crash: Sell All.
   `sellAll()` throws TypeError if user possesses an item (e.g. from
   older save/mod) that is not in the current price list.

2. UI Breakage: Long Text Overflow.
   Farm names > 50 chars expand the UI container indefinitely, breaking
   layout on mobile/smaller screens due to missing text-overflow CSS.

3. Exploit: Game Loop Speedup.
   Users can manually call `update(1000)` in console to speed up time
   as much as CPU allows. No tick-rate capping or validation.

4. Code Issue: CSS Variables.
   Code references `--bg1` but it is not defined in :root, potentially
   leading to fallback colors or inconsistencies.
